Narrator: Your name is Esli. You just quit your terrible job and felt the relief that comes with escaping bondage and a wickedly horrible boss. For a minute you felt for all the Chinese kids slaving away in sweatshops with no hope of being saved, but the prospect of discording for 12 hours a day until you got your next job made you forget about all that. IT'S PARTY TIME, BABY! This day was also your birthday. DOUBLE PARTY TIME, BABY!

Narrator: You found yourself lounging in the living room, fantasizing about chilling on VC with your wadabros. Objection.lol was on the agenda. Woo! You were exhausted, so exhausted from all the trials and tribulations leading up to this point. To make matters worse, it was as though your job haunted you, always surfacing in your sea of thoughts when you least expected it to. Your boss, your WHORE boss' existence was indistinguishable from a curse that vexed you even though she was no longer in your life. But you knew things wouldn't be like this forever. Matter of fact, you told yourself you would stop worrying and instead focus on having the coolest birthday of all time. Word!

Narrator: Where were we? Oh yeah, the doorbell rang. You lazily emerged from your sofa and walked up to the door. Hushed, unintelligible sentences from a number of people could be heard. When you opened the door, you saw none other than Finger...and Zecheru! And Ed, and Meepa, and Raul...wait...so many members of Wadacord had come to visit!

Zecheru enters from the left

Finger enters from the right

Zecheru (ed/Zecheru.webp): "Happy birthday Elsi, the Greek Boy", waltzing in with a cake box.
Finger (ed/Finger.png): "Ataturk, Kebab, Baklava" (Translated: There are some others who are still on their way)
Narrator: It was a surprise visit! Meepa and Ed fought over which party poppers were to be used. Ed thought it best to make a special party popper that fired Reg Moss's ip address. Meepa wanted to use normal party poppers, and said that there was no way he'd be okay with leaking Reg's personal information in a visual novel.

Narrator: In the middle of all the pomp and celebration, a statement of disbelief cut through the air like a scythe. "No...this can't be! Where did this letter come from? How did it get past us?" Zecheru looked worriedly at an envelope in front of him. It was charcoal black, with a crimson red pentagram drawn on its back with what seemed to be melted wax. He tore open the envelope and read out its contents along with the surprise guests who had all huddled behind him. Slowly, their expressions of worry turned into that of grit. "Esli...we'll be back. Whatever you do, don't read this letter. We're going to go and buy milk. Stay put."

Narrator: They promptly left her house. As for not reading the letter...yeah right lmao as if. You walked up and read it like your life depended on it. The letter read:
Narrator: "GOOD TIDINGS, ESLI. IT'S ME, YOUR BOSS. YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD ESCAPE MY CLUTCHES BUT YOU DIDN'T, YOU WON'T, AND SOON YOU'LL BE WORKING FOR ME AGAIN. I'VE ALREADY FOUGHT WITH YOUR PATHETIC LITTLE WADACORD FRIENDS SEVERAL TIMES AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN I'VE PROVEN VICTORIOUS. THEY CAN'T STOP ME FROM TAKING YOU BACK. SAVE SOME OF THAT CAKE FOR ME, WILL YOU? I'M DYING FOR A BITE.

Narrator: -With No Overtime Pay,

Narrator: Your Boss"

Narrator: You fell to your knees in despair. "How...how could this happen? Why is she still coming for me...after all this time...just why?" Then, your surprise guests suddenly leaving, were they on their way to fight her? And those guests who were still on their way...were they fighting her at that very moment? You...you slumped to your room in utter confusion and stared longingly at the portrait of Beatrice affixed to the wall.

Narrator: "Beatrice...Beatrice...what am I to do? Everything is going wrong..."

Narrator: Without warning...

Esli: waitwaitwait, what the fuck? Why are you here? Also when have I ever denied you?

Beatrice: Dude.

Esli: What?!

Beatrice: Why the fuck should I help ERIKA OF ALL PEOPLE?

Esli: Erika??? I'm Esli! Also known as pikopuyo? I have nothing to do with Erika!

Beatrice: Then how do you explain THIS?

Narrator: Beatrice lifted up a mirror.

Esli: Dawg I literally have a portrait of you in my room. Why would Erika have that?

Beatrice: Whatever, what do you want my help with?

Esli: My BITCH boss is chasing after me, and all my friends are fighting her and she might be winning and...and...I don't know what to do.

Beatrice: Have you tried love?

Esli: What the fuck are you talking about?

Beatrice: Okay, forget about that. There is a cat box in this gameboard. I've manipulated it to bolster your odds of victory. Fight valiantly, and remember, work hard, GAME hard. I'm out of here.

Narrator: Beatrice popped into a storm of golden butterflies that flew out of Esli's room. Esli was now alone again. She took out her phone to text Finger, but before she could even do anything her door burst open. Her boss arrived.

Narrator: A sound comparable to that of a huge explosion was produced. Esli's house shook from top to bottom. When she came to, she saw her boss' twitching insect body and Zecheru's goo-soaked fist.

Narrator: Meepa unsheathed his cool anime sword (he's so sugoii desu ne!) and stared coolly at the still-downed creature in front of him. He dashed and unhesitantly drove his sword into the fleshy hole left by Zecheru's 1000 Romanian Death-Fist attack.

Narrator: The demon let out an inhuman groan before fluttering off the ground.

Boss: "FUCK YOU, YOU FUCKING AMERICAN...bwooaarrghghgahrghgahrgh"

Narrator: Vomit mixed with blood and guts cascaded out of its mouth.

Boss: "But don't get too excited, for I am only approaching my second phase"

Narrator: The fly's erratic movements suddenly stopped as it remained airborne with perfect stillness.

Boss: "Covidus Trumpus...Ignoramus!"
Narrator: Luminescent purple inscriptions manifested on the furniture, and with a poof, all the Americans in the house disappeared.

Ed enters from the middle

Narrator: Amidst this horrible blow, Ed started bawling.

Ed: "MEEPA YOUUUUU WERE MY ONE AND ONLY FRIEND.....I LOVED YOU SO VERY MUCH...."

Ed: "Youuuu...don't kill more of my friends...please...take what you need and get Out of here..."

Ed moves to the left

Boss enters from the middle

Boss: "Cackle FINALLY, IT WAS ABOUT TIME YOU ALL STOPPED RESISTING ME."

Ed: "The cake is still on the table. Please, accept it as our surrender."

Narrator: The boss slowly sauntered to the cake box and licked its lips.

Boss: "MUEHEHEHE...I LIKE THE WAY YOU THINK, EDDY BOY!"

Narrator: It took the box and swallowed it whole.

Narrator: And just like that...

Narrator: AND JUST LIKE THAT...

Narrator: Everyone was stunned except for Saoirse and Ed. The crowd edged closer to the creature, and it was then that they realized what had happened - Esli's boss ate a whole mouthful of, not cake, but inexplicably, Zecheru's putrid cheese rice.

Goofy: "H-how?", plugging his nose, which clearly wasn't attuned to European cuisine.

bgm raul/far.mp3 plays

Narrator: Esli, you knew deep in your heart that Beatrice was behind all this. The cat box...was the cake box all along...woah...

Narrator: Thanks to a GPS tracker that Ed stuck up Meepa's left nostril while he wasn't looking, he and Cat were promptly located under the floorboards. After they were hoisted up, it was explained that in the middle of the scuffle, Saoirse's vegan senses picked up on a non-plant-based foodstuff in the cake box. She immediately told Ed, who didn't take long to put two and two together. However, this meant Esli didn't have any cake for this special occasion!

Raul enters from the right

Raul: "Wait, okay okay Esli. You sit right there. I'll bake a cake. I'm fucking cracked at this, just gimme a second"

Narrator: Saoirse and the United Nations intervened.

Ed enters from the left

Narrator: "Some of us got together and put together a special cake. I hope you enjoy it"

Narrator: And I hope you enjoy it, too!

Narrator: -Raul

Narrator: What is man but his vices?
Narrator: Chapter 1 - Coming to terms

Narrator: Humanity has shed its criminal dregs---the thought of instant retribution rings within the criminally inclined. There is no escape from Kira.
Narrator: After Mikami had expended his use, Kira struck a deal with the United Nations, to end crime in exchange for a board of 'Angels of Death', who would advise Kira on proceeding without influence or loyalty to anyone but Kira.

Narrator: These Angels of Death comprised members whose identities were only known to each other and Kira himself, all 5 of whom were elected in a blind vote.

Narrator: The recent debacle with Mello was at the forefront of Kira's psyche, although he had considered the possibility for criminals to bypass the restrictions of the Death Note, he hadn't paid much mind to it and accordingly lost 2 pieces, briefly placing Kira in a losing position.
Narrator: Kira commissioned the group to counter this and prevent further lapses of consideration.

Board: "The board has made considerable progress on the great problem, Mr. Kira. A consensus has been reached regarding the underlying traits that cause crime outside of justifiable necessity, megalomania. As always, the proof of this conclusion and the identity of your vessel are attached."

Ryuk: "The numerous advances in deanonymizing have made your tenure difficult, so as to speak."
Kira: "In no small part due to your efforts with that auctioneer. Was my plan really that boring?"
Ryuk: "I just don't find the administrative path you took very entertaining, though I can't say that the public's response was expected."
Kira: "Holding both the Death Note and this world in one hand isn't easy, though dealing with the renewed SPK was certainly the most fun I've had in some time."
Ryuk: "Thought that you weren't in it for your own entertainment, maybe you could take my place."
Kira: "I'm afraid that I couldn't live in the perfect society if I were a Shinigami, plus I don't like red apples that much."
Ryuk: "Heheh that takes me back, really loved that guy, shame you got bored of him."
Kira: "I certainly wasn't bored of him, L was probably the only guy that could understand how it feels to be me, though I'm afraid that his death was unavoidable."
Ryuk: "Are you praying that another detective pops up?"
Kira: "Maybe once I've finished with my world."

Narrator: L's exposition of the rules governing the Death Note was his magnum opus, perhaps a greater feat than theoretically exposing Kira's identity. Through unmatched deduction and thought experiments, he had taken the throne of the Shinigami King and simulated the events that would inform said rules. This uncanny accuracy even drove Ryuk to privately express his unsettlement, much less freaked Kira out.

Narrator: Chapter 2 - A misstep in the right direction
Kira: "Ah, they're still using the natural right hypothesis. Say Ryuk, how's the state of logic in the Shinigami realm?"
Ryuk: "Are you kidding me? Well, I might as well look over it, I can't say I've given your administrative approach much merit."
Ryuk: "Ah, this reminds me of that fraudster Deridovely's secrets, always knew something was up with his games."
Kira: "This is and, that's or, and that last thing there means that the entire symbol is inverted."
Ryuk: "Good luck with solving that then, why'd you decide to limit yourself to 'bad' and 'good' like that?"
Kira: "Well firstly, it's true and false but to answer your question succinctly, you need to try extending it with a third possibility, "neutral", which corresponds with your assumption."
Ryuk: "Why not use 'indifferent' instead?"
Kira: "Hm... You might be onto something Ryuk."
Ryuk: "Apple?"
Kira: "Here you go, don't eat the core this time."

Kira: I'll have to start thinking about how to communicate as Kira without the Death Note, asking the board is a death sentence, I'm sure the US will take it as a sign that my job's almost finished and just eliminate me with the subtlety of a nuclear explosion once they think that they can do my work.
Ryuk: "hedefinize hızla yaklaşan bir nükleer bomba var"
Kira: "Cut it out."
Ryuk: "They aren't usually that interesting, so no, I won't."
Kira: Going back over my potential solutions may help solve it, axiomizing my logical process would solve both this and the issue of blind trust, but that will take some time to complete.
Kira: "You hate apples don't you?"
Ryuk: "I can't help it."
Kira: "Hm, I guess hinging designs on your abundance or the lack thereof seems illogical now that I go through it."
<!-- detective is aligned with kira idealistically, but has no loyalty -->

Narrator: Elsi, ever the optimist, thought she could just waltz right out of the Wadalands. But let’s be real—who in their right mind would let you leave after you’ve had that much NUT water?
clear
Gort: (sipping his cocoNUT) You might not want to go just yet. You see, the Wadalands have a... way of keeping you. Things don’t just leave.
clear

clear
Elsi: (laughing) Yeah, okay, keep your spooky stories to yourselves. I’m not that easily scared, bros..
clear
Narrator: But something was off. A chill ran through the air, and the once playful colors of the Wadalands now felt... wrong. It’s not the same ol gay place as before…
clear
Narrator: First, the cockroach started shaking. Then the capybara froze mid-sip, its eyes locked on something in the distance.
clear
Gort: (sipping his cocoNUT) It’s happening again…
clear
Elsi: (squinting like a chinese) What’s happening?
clear
Abdul: (looking over his shoulder) You hear that?
clear
Narrator: A distant rumble vibrated through the ground. A dark fog, thick as tar, began to roll in from the edges of the yard, swallowing up the bright colors like a slow-motion disaster. The air grew stale. The ground felt... wrong.
clear
Elsi: (nervously) What the hell is that?
clear
Narrator: From the shadows of the fog, shapes began to emerge. They weren’t quite human. Or animal. They weren’t anything you could put a FINGER on, but the way they moved was too smooth, too deliberate. Their eyes glowed an unnatural shade of red, piercing through the mist.
clear
Abdul: (shivering) The cocks are out. I told you... You’re not supposed to go too far past the general balkan.
clear
Narrator: At this point, even Elsi, in all her high-as-a-kite glory, couldn’t deny something was wrong. The creatures—the cocks, as Abdul called them—came closer, their steps silent, their forms twisting and bending in impossible ways.
clear
Elsi: (pointing) What the hell are they?
clear
Gort: (sipping his cocoNUT) No one really knows. Some say they’re the forgotten ones, souls who got too curious about the Wadalands and never left. Others say they’re something much older... and much worse.
clear
Abdul: (nervously) They don’t like people who laugh. Or make noise. Or, uh, talk too much…
clear
Narrator: Elsi, ever the jokester, couldn’t help herself.
clear
Elsi: (laughing nervously) Okay, okay. So we’ve got some goat weirdos, what’s the big deal? We’ve got sipping capybaras and cockroaches performing tantric edging rituals. This place is crazy.
clear
Narrator: Big mistake. Elsi’s laughter rang out, echoing like an alarm bell. One of the creatures twitched, and with a speed that defied logic, it shot forward, it went straight to general chat. IT…WAS…A…ONE PIECE…EDIT
clear
Elsi: (screaming) WHOA, FUCK!
clear
Narrator: The thing was fast—too fast—and Elsi’s instinct was to jump back. But as she did, the ground under her feet crumbled away, like some sick cosmic trap was ready to swallow her whole.
clear
Abdul: (frantically) You shouldn’t have laughed! You shouldn’t have….
clear
Narrator: The last thing Elsi saw before everything went dark was Abdul’s horrified face. Then the chat went silent.
clear
Narrator: Elsi awoke. This time, it wasn’t the soft, grassy backyard she had found herself in earlier. No, this time she was in a place... vastly different.
clear
Narrator: Elsi started to regret checking the hole. 
clear
Narrator: She started to scream.
clear
Narrator: Elsi's scream echoed through the abyss, but it didn’t sound like it was going anywhere. The air around her was thick and heavy, and the ground felt as if it might just evaporate under her feet at any second. The sky? A dull, oppressive gray. The air? Smelled like 90% alcohol. (Did fucking Zecheru described Romania Winter).
clear
Elsi: (desperately) WHERE AM I NOW?!
clear
Narrator: Elsi’s voice barely cut through the silence. The landscape around her was an endless stretch of nothing. But, wait... was that a flicker of movement in the distance?
clear
Narrator: She squinted, her vision still fuzzy from whatever the hell had just happened. And then, like a glitch in reality, something appeared. Something that made Elsi’s stomach drop to her shoes.
clear
Narrator: A giant hand—no, a giant FINGER—broke through the ground like it had been buried for centuries. It wasn’t human. It wasn’t animal. It was a...It was a… turk. A turk made out of endless hours played in FIFA 2024 (it's not a paid promotion).
clear
Elsi: (in horror) What... the fuck?
clear
Narrator: FINGER didn’t say anything. It didn’t need to. A lurkers job is to lurk. Finger started looking directly at Elsi, like it was deciding whether or not to press "send" on the most cursed meme ever created.
clear
Narrator: Elsi stood frozen, trying to figure out what was happening. Did the NUT juice fucked me really good ?
clear
Narrator: And then, the ground rumbled. Again.
clear
Narrator: A distant howl echoed from the shadows, followed by the sound of clicking—the sound was worse then the discord ping from Halloween 2024. 
clear
Elsi: (gulping) What is it now...?
clear
Narrator: The creatures crawled from the fog, their bodies distorted in ways that couldn’t possibly make sense. 
clear
Narrator: The Americans joined the chat.
